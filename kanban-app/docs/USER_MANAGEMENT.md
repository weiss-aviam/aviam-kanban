# User Management for Board Admins

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the user management functionality accessible only to board administrators.

## Overview

The user management system allows board administrators (owners and admins) to:
- Invite new users to boards
- Manage user roles and permissions
- Remove users from boards
- Reset user passwords
- View audit logs of all admin actions
- Monitor board membership statistics

## Architecture

### Database Schema

The user management system extends the existing database schema with:

- `admin_audit_log` - Tracks all admin actions for security and compliance
- `user_invitations` - Manages pending user invitations
- Enhanced `board_memberships` table with role-based permissions

### API Endpoints

All admin endpoints are secured with comprehensive validation and rate limiting:

#### User Management
- `GET /api/admin/users` - List board users with pagination and filtering
- `POST /api/admin/users` - Invite new users to the board
- `PATCH /api/admin/users/[id]` - Update user details and roles
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/[id]` - Remove user from board
- `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/reset-password` - Reset user password

#### Membership Management
- `GET /api/admin/memberships` - Get board memberships with activity stats
- `PATCH /api/admin/memberships` - Update membership roles

#### Audit Logging
- `GET /api/admin/audit-logs` - View admin action audit logs with filtering

### Security Features

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication required for all endpoints
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with owner/admin permissions
- Board-level access validation
- Service role authentication for admin operations

#### Rate Limiting
- Operation-specific rate limits:
  - User invitations: 20 per hour
  - Password resets: 10 per hour
  - General admin operations: 500 per hour
- IP-based rate limiting with automatic cleanup

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Comprehensive Zod schema validation
- XSS and SQL injection prevention
- Email normalization and validation
- UUID format validation for all IDs

#### Audit Logging
- All admin actions are logged with:
  - Admin user ID and target user ID
  - IP address and user agent
  - Detailed action context
  - Severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Automatic security event detection

## Frontend Components

### UserManagementModal
Main modal component with tabbed interface:
- **Users Tab**: List and manage existing users
- **Invite Tab**: Invite new users (single or bulk)
- **Memberships Tab**: View membership statistics and manage roles
- **Audit Log Tab**: View admin action history

### Key Components
- `UserList` - Paginated user list with search and filtering
- `InviteUserForm` - Single and bulk user invitation
- `EditUserModal` - Edit user details and roles
- `MembershipTable` - Board membership overview with activity stats
- `AuditLogTable` - Filterable audit log with export functionality

## Custom Hooks

### useUserManagement
Core hook for user management operations:
```typescript
const {
  loading,
  error,
  fetchUsers,
  inviteUser,
  updateUser,
  removeUser,
  resetPassword,
  bulkInviteUsers,
  clearError,
} = useUserManagement({
  onSuccess: (message) => console.log(message),
  onError: (error) => console.error(error),
});
```

### useBoardMemberships
Hook for membership management:
```typescript
const {
  memberships,
  summary,
  loading,
  error,
  updateMembership,
  bulkUpdateMemberships,
  refresh,
} = useBoardMemberships({
  boardId: 'board-123',
  autoRefresh: true,
});
```

### useAuditLogs
Hook for audit log management:
```typescript
const {
  auditLogs,
  summary,
  pagination,
  filters,
  updateFilters,
  exportLogs,
  nextPage,
  prevPage,
} = useAuditLogs({
  boardId: 'board-123',
  autoRefresh: false,
});
```

### useAdminPanel
Comprehensive hook combining all admin functionality:
```typescript
const adminPanel = useAdminPanel({
  boardId: 'board-123',
  currentUserRole: 'admin',
  autoRefresh: true,
});

if (!adminPanel) {
  // User is not admin
  return null;
}

const {
  activeTab,
  setActiveTab,
  isLoading,
  notifications,
  inviteUser,
  updateUser,
  removeUser,
  refreshAll,
} = adminPanel;
```

## Role-Based Permissions

### Owner Permissions
- All admin permissions
- Can assign admin roles
- Can transfer ownership (future feature)
- Cannot be removed from board

### Admin Permissions
- Invite users (member, viewer roles only)
- Update user details and roles (except admin)
- Remove users (except owners and other admins)
- Reset passwords
- View audit logs
- Manage memberships

### Member/Viewer Permissions
- No admin access
- Cannot access user management features

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All sensitive operations require admin authentication
- Service role operations are server-side only
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Audit logs capture all admin actions

### Rate Limiting
- Prevents abuse of admin operations
- Different limits for different operation types
- IP-based tracking with automatic cleanup

### Error Handling
- Secure error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation on failures

## Usage Examples

### Inviting a User
```typescript
// Single user invitation
await inviteUser({
  email: 'newuser@example.com',
  role: 'member',
  boardId: 'board-123',
});

// Bulk user invitation
await bulkInviteUsers([
  { email: 'user1@example.com', role: 'member' },
  { email: 'user2@example.com', role: 'viewer' },
], 'board-123');
```

### Updating User Role
```typescript
await updateUser('user-id', 'board-123', {
  role: 'admin', // Only owners can assign admin role
});
```

### Viewing Audit Logs
```typescript
// Fetch audit logs with filters
await fetchAuditLogs({
  action: 'invite_user',
  startDate: '2023-01-01T00:00:00Z',
  endDate: '2023-12-31T23:59:59Z',
});
```

## Testing

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Database Migrations
Run the provided SQL migrations to set up required tables:
```sql
-- See schema.sql for complete migration
```

### Monitoring
- Set up alerts for critical security events
- Monitor rate limiting metrics
- Track audit log volume and patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Ownership transfer functionality
- Advanced role customization
- Bulk operations for membership management
- Email notification system for admin actions
- Advanced audit log analytics

### Performance Optimizations
- Redis-based rate limiting for production
- Audit log archiving and compression
- Real-time updates with WebSocket connections
- Caching for frequently accessed data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Wait for the rate limit window to reset
2. **Permission Denied**: Verify user has admin role on the board
3. **Invalid Board ID**: Ensure board ID is a valid UUID
4. **User Already Exists**: Check if user is already a member

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in development:
```typescript
// Set NODE_ENV=development for detailed logging
```

### Support
